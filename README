For this project I create a program creates Non-deterministic finite automaton(Or  Nfa)
from a regular expression (i.e. (a|b).(c.d). and then use the nfa to see if the regualr expression
matches any string that the program is given.
I will do this by adding in shunter algorithm to the code. The shunter should take the expression given 
and then go through each character in the string of the expression given. If the first character
is '(' then it is added to the stack. Other characters added to the stack such as '*','.' and '|'.
If the next character is a normal character such as 'a' then it is added to the ouptput( or post fix).
If ')' is encoutered during the string, then the first thing on the stack is then added to the ouput.
Keeps adding to the output till all characters in the string has been went through.

I then put in the Thompson Constructor in the code, where I created two classes, one called state and nfa. The thompson 
constructor parses the postfix expression fromt the shunter algorthim and turns it into a nfa.
